# What is this

This Project is an attempt to demonstrate some possible practises when developing a basic frontend.

The steps I will include will be:
- Initial UX explorations
- Design will be skipped, so the UX explorations will be built as is
- Approach to TDD (Test Driven Development)
- Good Practices in the build itself in regards to React Frontends


## Initial UX explorations

Find example [here](https://excalidraw.com/#json=Ic51nMwCSgIWIFiE47y-f,A2RfBRUkCapNVUcaOEWsHg)

In this diagram you will see some initial planning based on some made up requirements to build a screen that can search for movies. 

This example is basic, it starts by evaluating what sort of states will be required in the app based on the information available to it. Think about what you would change, and how that would affect the user experience. This is a good place to be creative and visualize how any out-of-the-box ideas might play out

## Roadmap
